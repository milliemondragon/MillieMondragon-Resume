        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first-generation Hispanic woman from San Bernardino who decided not to settle for what I have known, but to aspire to be something more. I decided to attend college because I would like a brighter future for myself and my family. My career path falls under Psychology, as I aspire to be a guidance counselor either at the High School or College level. I envision this as my future career because I am passionate about helping people. This career directly impacts the generations of tomorrow and I would like to be a part of preparing the future of this world. The rewards would consist of helping students, whose position I was once in, prosper and become something great. I am currently working part-time at a 6-12 school as a tutor, which reminds me on a daily basis how much I enjoy working to help students.<br><br>

        I have experienced numerous events that serve as strongholds in my life which could’ve easily changed me for the worse. Nonetheless, I surpassed these events and have become the best person that I possibly can be which has taught me a lot about reality. I am not afraid to say that I don’t have all of the answers to my life because I don’t. Not knowing all of the answers has allowed me to stay motivated and continue to explore this world in an attentive manner. This is why I continue to remain a good person who is willing to help anyone in need since I know how it feels to be in that position judging from my hardships. Although I am just starting my academic journey at the University of California Riverside, I am excited for what is to come. The career that I am interested in is school counseling. I am interested in this career because I was inspired by the counselor at my school. I am passionate about helping people and high school counselors are extremely valuable because they help the next generation. High school marks the beginning of the endless opportunities and I would like to contribute to society in that way. The rewards would consist of helping students, whose position I was once in, prosper and become something great.<br><br>

        Community service is something that allows me to help others, which I really enjoy. I have been involved in many clubs and events throughout my community. Kiwanis Key club, in particular, opens many doors for community service, with them I have participated in campus cleanups, dog and cat toy making events, building of a rose bowl parade float, leadership retreats such as Key Leader, and Christmas card making events. Through being apart of  Global Leadership Academy I have also gotten the opportunity to participate in Blood Drives, Christmas Toy Drives, and in the annual Inland Empire Greek Festival. I have also taken a step towards my future career and participated in the SBCUSD Counseling Student Advisory which advocates for school counseling programs. I have aided my local elementary schools by participating in afterschool programs such as CAPS and helping teachers in classrooms. I have also helped my local community college, San Bernardino Valley College in the midterm elections by advocating for Measure CC during an event that they held. It is very important for me to see my community prosper which is why I look forward to continuing contributing in various different ways. Through my work, at the University of California Riverside, I hope to be a part of something that will directly impact the generations of tomorrow in a positive manner.<br><br>
